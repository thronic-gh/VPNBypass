## VPN Bypass | Local Domain Based Routing
VPN Bypass can bypass local VPN, by routing specific domains to the local gateway, like it would usually work when VPN is not active.

![Example UI](example_ui.jpg)

VPN providers that implement their own traffic inspection and firewall filter will not be bypassed by this software. So your mileage may vary. Any existing antivirus solution must also accept automatic hosts file changes for VPN Bypass to work optimally. 

Tested with TigerVPN, OpenVPN (should work with all providers supporting and using it) and F-Secure FREEDOME. Originally made for Plex, which uses Amazon CDN and rotating/load balancing IP addresses, making simple scripts inadequate. 

This software installs/removes an added service via the user interface that keeps all hosts in the list updated. (Version 1.2.0+ now also supports round-robin / load balancing where a single domain may point to multiple IP adresses). 

If your VPN metric is lower than default Bypass routes, just turn off automatic metric in your NIC and set it to 1. This is a setting available in ncpa.cpl > NIC Properties > TCP/IPv4 properties > Advanced.

TIP: You do not need to have client program open (some users seem to think so), it's just for viewing log and stop/starting the service.
